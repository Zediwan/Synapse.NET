# 🧪 Synapse.NET

A modular, extensible neural network library for C#/.NET projects. Designed for dynamic and evolutionary expansion, allowing the creation and growth of neural networks at runtime—including adding new layers and nodes, structural mutation, and advanced visualization.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Synapse.NET** empowers C# and .NET developers to:
- Build neural networks dynamically and programmatically
- Evolve networks using genetic algorithms (mutation, crossover)
- Compare and visualize network structures
- Save/load networks to/from files
- Extend with custom layers, activation functions, and more

Use it as a reusable package in your own projects, freeing you from reimplementing neural network code every time.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Dynamic addition and removal of layers, nodes, and connections at runtime
- Evolutionary expansion: mutate structure by adding/removing elements
- Ability to cross (combine) neural networks to produce child networks
- Structural similarity comparison algorithms
- Visualizer for inspecting architectures, connection weights, and properties
- Saving and loading networks (serialization/deserialization)
- Modular, extensible API for custom extensions
- Ready for integration with any C#/.NET project

---

## 📦 Technologies

- C#, .NET 6+
- (Optional) Math.NET Numerics for advanced math
- (Optional) WPF for visualization
- Distributed as a NuGet package
